A utility class to indicate a desired ordering method.

A class constant `DATA` acts as a collection of commonspeak and symbolic methods.

However, a pattern has developed in which there are two distinct varieties dinstinguished by their instance methods. 

## Resource Index Sorter

- includes path methods declared in [[Routes]] when this is a selectable option to re-order the index, with a `filter` parameter which the Controller passes to the Query
- does not perform any query or ordering methods

## Resource HABTM Sorter

- uses [[has_many Join Model]] singeton methods to sort nested resources
