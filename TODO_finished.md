# A&R.Local To-Do List


## Possibly finished

Album.duration(round_to_seconds) should have new option variable instead of boolean. And should be properly written.
**Not sure what the problem was here, or if anything short of a `Duration` object would be a *proper* fix.**
album.duration(rounded_to: :seconds) is better syntax/semantics

route/controller/etc for various _join_by_keyword **seems okay**

Possibly some bugs remaining here.

- review video picture import-- does it still fail? Check upload too.
- Fixed, BUT:
  - Video :has_one picture as a thumbnail
  -   by comparison,
  - Event :has_many pictures as a collection
  -   therefore
  - The supplementary methods for importing will look different.
  - Should this remain, or should Video-Picture be a :has_many relationship?
  - **Probably should be a :has_many relationship for consistency.**
  - ***Is that certain? Video only needs a thumbnail.***
  - but it might be useful to have a collection of stills, just as an event can have several pictures.
  - db table already video_pictures, just add video_order.


## Probably finished

***Admin Pictures Index - make default button => pin icon***

views/shared is now views/public/shared

- admin_header_nav

- video -> keywords CSS in join table headings and data

- keyword.title_with_[rsource]_count
  - are these still being used? **Yes. in `_form_[]_join_by_keyword`**
  - anything remaining reason to keep this? no?

- Consider ActionText (sp?) for text_markup fields. No, requires webpacker &c.

clean up colors
  errors.scss
  events_index .arl_events_index_by_year
no more @includes for layout

clean up fonts (public)
clean up fonts (admin)
neighbor nav button css
isrc#review switch between index (for easy copy/paste) and edit
picture selection
views/shared vs view/form_elements
html_head_helper
  put favicon and javascript logic into respective layout templates
  is google analytics still a thing?
css image/border mixins

see:
resource.visibility
  ['indexed','unlisted','private'] (2,1,0)
  see album
  also Enum?
    https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes
    https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#enums
    (although probably not.)
  source_attachment_attachment -> source_upload_attachment
  infopage.published database attribute

Is query_info_page.rb still in use? **No.**

- views/admin/shared/_index_joined
  - is this used beyond Picture? **No.**
  - app/views/admin/pictures/_show_joined_resources.haml
  - previous plan was for shared partials showing joined resources
  - is this still the plan, or should this be refactored into individual resource view partials?
    - contrast with `_admin_[resource]_stats.haml`
  - **Decision** _these partials have view logic that should be kept DRY. Consider including with other `admin#resource#show`, especially Keyword._
  - **In fact,** already being addressed in admin view overhaul.

- review routes for semantic/logical cohesion
  - obsolete routes are commented. I think all of them.
  - some are not currently in use.

***more useful 'show' action for resources***
  **"Album" is the model.**

- the 'source_attachment_attachment' syntax looks horrible. Is this really the best way to distinguish source_attachment from source_catalog?

Content storage descriptions

picture_helper has a few sus methods
**They're all called somewhere in app/*, but recent refactoring might have made some inactive calls.**

- Rails 7 upgrade
  - does importmap-rails apply? **Probably not.**
  - does jsbundling-rails apply? **Probably not.**

pictures -> video **DONE**
  and
    import to video
    upload to video

- what is this: in `app/assets/stylesheets/evo/2_public/jplayer/1_jp_audio.scss :: 2`
  *Doesn't matter now that evo is gone*
  > // TODO: figure out why this doesn't render border-bottom or border-top
  > // see .jp-type-playlist for border-bottom.
  > // see .arl_albums_show_player for border-top.

  audio: why are durations `super.to_i`? *historical reasons. refactor to where integers are necessary, leave attribute method alone.*
  wording mismatch between album.duration and audio.duration
  `rounded_to` implies data manipulation **More accurate wording**
  `precision` implies observation
    - album has `duration(rounded_to: :units)`
    - audio has `duration_as_text(precision: :units)`
    also look at album_audio, event_audio, etc.
    does events need event.playlist_duration or something similar? *yagniâ€¦y*

  album_audio.rb &c
  there are singleton methods that might not reflect the current reality.
  e.g. line 10-28  `# TODO: Is this still a potentially useful method or code pattern?` **no.**

  several joined_resource models have wrapper methods to prevent failure if joined is nil
  is this pattern obsolete? **YES.**
  - Why does PictureKeyword have an `id_public` method? It's not even directly accessible.
    - related: are the redundant join methods such as `PictureKeyword#picture_title #picture_id #picture_slug` still needed?

  - autokeyword formatting
  - audio/picture not found -- clearer indicator *maybe a preceeding question mark*

  resource.visibility:
    "private" isn't really private, there is still a direct URL if a file is in storage
    - see visibility_helper
    - choose new name?
      - indexed
      - attachable
      - unlisted
      - private
    - **NO. IT GETS TOO COMPLICATED.**
      - keep ['public','unlisted','private']
      - add a disclaimer
